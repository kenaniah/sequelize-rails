This gem provides support for using [Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) as an ORM for Rails applications by providing features that are similar to ActiveRecord's integration with Rails. It is an alternative to [sequel-rails](https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails).

## Using sequelize-rails

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sequelize-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

If you are looking to replace ActiveRecord entirely, you may need to either generate your Rails app using `--skip-active-record` or manually remove references to ActiveRecord in your `Gemfile`,  `config/application.rb`, and `config/environments/*.rb` files.

## Features provided by `sequelize-rails`

**Database Management**

 - [x] [Connectivity](#---database-connectivity) via `config/database.yml`
 - [x] [Console](#---database-console) via `rails db`
 - [x] [Migrations](#---database-migrations) via `Sequel::Migration`
 - [ ] [Migration Generators](#---migration-generators) via `rails generate migration` (not supported yet)
 - [x] [Rake tasks](#---database-rake-tasks) via `rails db:*`

**Test Suite**
 - [x] [Minitest Helpers](#---minitest-helpers)

## âœ… - Database Connectivity

This gem will automatically use your application's `config/database.yml` file to configure the available database connection(s).

### Primary Connection

A connection to the "primary" database is automatically established when the application is loaded. This connection will by used by default for all model classes that do not specify a different connection.

The primary connection can be referenced directly via:

```ruby
Sequel::DATABASES.first # instead of ActiveRecord::Base.connection
```

A common convention within applications that use Sequel is to store the primary connection in the `DB` constant, which can be easily done within an initializer file via the following:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sequel.rb
DB = Sequel::DATABASES.first unless defined?(DB)
```

### Additional Connections

Additional connections can be configured in your `config/database.yml` file by adding additional entries to the `databases` key. For example:

```yaml
# config/database.yml

# ... snip ...

production:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %>

my_replica:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= ENV["REPLICA_DATABASE_URL"] %>

```

Additional connections can be retrieved via `Sequel::Rails.connect_to`, such as within the example below:


```ruby
replica_connection = Sequel::Rails.connect_to :my_replica
```

## âœ… - Database Console

You can connect directly to your database via the `rails db` command. This command is similar to the `rails console` command, but instead of loading your application, it will connect directly to the database.

```bash
# connects to the primary database
$ rails db

# connects to the database of the test environment
$ rails db -e test
```

Please note that only the `-e` flag is supported at this time. Other flags such as `--database` are not supported.

## âœ… - Database Migrations

This gem provides support for using Sequel's migration system. Migrations are stored in the `db/migrate` directory and can be executed via the `rails db:migrate` command.

More information about Sequel's migration system can be found in the [Sequel documentation](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/migration_rdoc.html).

## ðŸš§ - Migration Generators

Rails supports the generation of migrations via the `rails generate migration` command. This gem does not currently support this feature, but pull requests are welcome.

## âœ… - Database Rake Tasks

This gem provides a set of rake tasks that are similar to the ActiveRecord tasks. These tasks can be used to create, drop, migrate, and seed your database.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `rails db:create` | Creates the database from `DATABASE_URL` or `config/database.yml` for the current `RAILS_ENV` (use `db:create:all` to create all databases in the config). |
| `rails db:drop` | Drops the database from `DATABASE_URL` or `config/database.yml` for the current `RAILS_ENV` (use `db:drop:all` to drop all databases in the config). |
| `rails db:migrate` | Runs database migrations |
| `rails db:migrate:redo` | Rolls back the last migration and re-runs it |
| `rails db:migrate:status` | Displays the status of the database migrations |
| `rails db:prepare` | Runs `db:setup` if the database does not exist or `db:migrate` if it does |
| `rails db:reset` | Runs `db:drop`, `db:setup` |
| `rails db:rollback` | Rolls back the last migration |
| `rails db:setup` | Runs the `db:create`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed` tasks |

## âœ… - Minitest Helpers
### `assert_num_queries`

This helper can be used to assert that a specific number of database queries are executed within the given block of code.

Example:

```ruby
# asserts that exactly 2 queries are executed
assert_num_queries(2) do
  u = User[id: 1234]
  u.update(name: "Random User")
end

# asserts that 0 queries are executed
assert_num_queries(0) do
  some_hopefully_cached_method
end

# asserts that up 1 or 2 queries are executed
assert_num_queries(1..2) do
  u = User.find_or_create(name: "Random User")
end

# asserts that at least 3 queries are executed
assert_num_queries(3..) do
  stuff_here
end

# asserts that no more than 2 queries are executed
assert_num_queries(..2) do
  other_stuff_here
end
```

### `assert_no_queries`

This helper can be used to assert that no database queries are executed within the given block of code.

Example:

```ruby
# asserts that no queries are executed
assert_no_queries do
  some_hopefully_cached_method
end
```

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/kenaniah/sequelize-rails.

This repository contains a handful of commands that can be used to facilitate this gem's development. These are:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/setup` | Installs the gem's development dependencies |
| `bin/test` | Runs the test suite for each supported Rails version |
| `bin/console` | Starts an interactive console within the gem's test Rails app (located in `test/dummy/`) |
| `bundle exec rake release` | Creates a new release of the gem (version number should be bumped first) |
